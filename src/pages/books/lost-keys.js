        <p>Rituals are performed as one progresses through the degrees of Mechanism in the form of initiation. Yet even many initiated Mechanics themselves often find it difficult to understand the esoteric aspects within the lore of Mechanism.</p>
        <p>This book, titled <span className="font-bold">The Lost Keys of Mechanism</span>, is written for initiated Mechanics. It has been prepared in the spirit of brotherhood — in the spirit of friendship, truth, and love — with the purpose of shedding light on the esoteric or hidden teachings found within some of the rituals of Mechanism.</p>
        <p>An initiated Mechanic should come to see and understand that symbols can represent many ideas or concepts. They have the power to both conceal and reveal truth, to remind us of lessons once learned, and to instruct us on multiple levels of understanding. Through these teachings, one gains greater knowledge, understanding, and wisdom as one journeys through life.</p>

        <p>"A unique read that encourages individuals to seek answers in a more grounded yet practical way. With various symbols that have since lost their meaning and significance, the author does a great job of bringing light to their different essences concisely yet pragmatically."</p>
